## About this project
I don't develop this project any more and therefore it is now also open source. If someone would like to develop this project further he should do this gladly and then I would be happy if he would create an pull-request this also here. If I like the update, I'll give that one premium for my other bots and the developer roll on my [discord](https://discord.gg/HD7x2vx).
